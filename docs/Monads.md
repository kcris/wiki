### **why do we need monads?**

1. We want to program **only using functions**. ("functional programming (FP)" after all).
2. Then, we have a first big problem. This is a program: 

f(x) = 2 * x 

g(x,y) = x / y How can we say **what is to be executed first**? How can we form an ordered sequence of functions (i.e. **a program**) _using no more than functions_? Solution: **compose functions**. If you want first 

g and then 

f, just write 

f(g(x,y)). This way, "the program" is a function as well: 

main = f(g(x,y)). OK, but ... 
3. More problems: some functions **might fail** (i.e. 

g(2,0), divide by 0). We have **no "exceptions"**in FP (an exception is not a function). How do we solve it? Solution: Let's **allow functions to return two kind of things**: instead of having 

g : Real,Real -&gt; Real (function from two reals into a real), let's allow 

g : Real,Real -&gt; Real | Nothing(function from two reals into (real or nothing)). 
4. But functions should (to be simpler) return only **one thing**. Solution: let's create a new type of data to be returned, a "**boxing type**" that encloses maybe a real or be simply nothing. Hence, we can have 

g : Real,Real -&gt; Maybe Real. OK, but ... 
5. What happens now to 

f(g(x,y))? 

f is not ready to consume a 

Maybe Real. And, we don't want to change every function we could connect with 

g to consume a 

Maybe Real. Solution: let's **have a special function to "connect"/"compose"/"link" functions**. That way, we can, behind the scenes, adapt the output of one function to feed the following one. In our case: 

g &gt;&gt;= f (connect/compose 

g to 

f). We want 

&gt;&gt;= to get 

g's output, inspect it and, in case it is 

Nothing just don't call 

f and return 

Nothing; or on the contrary, extract the boxed 

Real and feed 

f with it. (This algorithm is just the implementation of 

&gt;&gt;= for the 

Maybetype). Also note that 

&gt;&gt;= must be written **only once** per "boxing type" (different box, different adapting algorithm). 
6. Many other problems arise which can be solved using this same pattern: 1. Use a "box" to codify/store different meanings/values, and have functions like 

g that return those "boxed values". 2. Have a composer/linker 

g &gt;&gt;= f to help connecting 

g's output to 

f's input, so we don't have to change any 

f at all. 
7. Remarkable problems that can be solved using this technique are: 
    - having a global state that every function in the sequence of functions ("the program") can share: solution 

StateMonad. 
    - We don't like "impure functions": functions that yield _different_ output for _same_ input. Therefore, let's mark those functions, making them to return a tagged/boxed value: 

IOmonad. 

Total happiness !!!!
